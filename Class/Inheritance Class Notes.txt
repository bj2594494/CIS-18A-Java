Inheritance-the mechanism in Java by which one class is allow to inherit the 
	    features(fields and methods) of another class.
	   -uses keyword "extends"

Super Class: The class whose features are inherited is known as super
	     class(or a base class or a parent class).

Sub Class: The class that inherits the other class is known as sub 
	   class(or a derived class, extended class, or child class).
	   The subclass can add its own fields and methods in addition 
	   to the superclass fields and methods.

Reusability: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, 
	     i.e. when we want to create a new class and there 
	     is already a class that includes some of the code 
	     that we want, we can derive our new class from the
	     existing class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields 
	     and methods of the existing class.


class child_class extends parent_class{
	members of the child class
