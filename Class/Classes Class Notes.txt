Object Oriented Programming
Class:
	class name - what it is
	attributes - property of a class
	actions (methods/functions) - behavior that perform on a class
	objects - a copy or an instance of a class in a compiler program

Access modifiers: tell Java what scope of visibilty an attribute of method has

	1. Default - No keyword required, accessible only within the same package
	2. Private - keyword "private," accessible only within the class in which they are declared
	3. Protected - keyword "protected," accessible within the same package or sub classes in different package
	4. Public - keyword "public," widest scope, accessible form every where in the program

data encapsulation: information hiding -> make member variable private

test driven development (TDD): classes with test cases => infinite number of inputs to see if they pass
	=> anywhere you fail, you go back and fix it ==== also called "unit testing"

Class Codes:
		get memberVarName 
		set memberVarName
