Comment: It was my first time using class in Java and I had some difficulties. The whole idea of class 
was bit difficult for me to understand (both in C++ and Java) and I had some challenging time trying to figure out
how to utilize the class that I wrote in the main class. But I do think that if I can fully
use the class, it would make my future programming easier.
